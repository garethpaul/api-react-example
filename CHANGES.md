# API React Example Changes

## 2026-06-08

- Added an explicit ESLint gate for the React source tree and wired it into `verify`.
- Updated the README verification flow to use Corepack-backed Yarn with the checked-in `yarn.lock`.
- Extended the source baseline check to guard the lint script, changelog, and documented verification commands.
